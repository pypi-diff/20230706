It should consist only of alphanumeric\n     characters, dashes, plus signs, and dots.\n\n     The option\u2019s argument is available to the shell commands\n     ACTION-IF-GIVEN in the shell variable \u2018withval\u2019, which is actually\n     just the value of the shell variable named \u2018with_PACKAGE\u2019, with any\n     non-alphanumeric characters in PACKAGE changed into \u2018_\u2019.  You may\n     use that variable instead, if you wish.\n\n     Note that ACTION-IF-NOT-GIVEN is not expanded until the point that\n     \u2018AC_ARG_WITH\u2019 was expanded.  If you need the value of\n     \u2018with_PACKAGE\u2019 set to a default value by the time argument parsing\n     is completed, use \u2018m4_divert_text\u2019 to the \u2018DEFAULTS\u2019 diversion\n     (*note m4_divert_text::) (if done as an argument to \u2018AC_ARG_WITH\u2019,\n     also provide non-diverted text to avoid a shell syntax error).\n\n     The argument HELP-STRING is a description of the option that looks\n     like this:\n            --with-readline         support fancy command line editing\n\n     HELP-STRING may be more than one line long, if more detail is\n     needed.

(You must add \u2018EXTRA_DIST = input\u2019\n     to your \u2018Makefile.am\u2019 if \u2018input\u2019 is a source file.)\n\n     Similarly\n\n          file=output\n          file2=out:in\n          ...\n          AC_CONFIG_FILES([$file:input],, [file=$file])\n          AC_CONFIG_FILES([$file2],, [file2=$file2])\n\n     will only cause \u2018input\u2019 to be distributed.  No file will be cleaned\n     automatically (add \u2018DISTCLEANFILES = output out\u2019 yourself), and no\n     rebuild rule will be output.\n\n     Obviously \u2018automake\u2019 cannot guess what value \u2018$file\u2019 is going to\n     hold later when \u2018configure\u2019 is run, and it cannot use the shell\n     variable \u2018$file\u2019 in a \u2018Makefile\u2019.

Even\n     \u2018AC_SUBST\u2019 does not help here, because \u2018automake\u2019 needs to know the\n     file name when it runs in order to check whether \u2018Makefile.am\u2019\n     exists.

To call a Fortran subroutine from C or to write a C\n     function that is callable from Fortran, the C program must\n     explicitly use identifiers in the format expected by the Fortran\n     compiler.

For instance, on\n\n          file=input\n          ...\n          AC_CONFIG_FILES([output:$file],, [file=$file])\n\n     \u2018automake\u2019 will output rules to clean \u2018output\u2019, and rebuild it.\n     However the rebuild rule will not depend on \u2018input\u2019, and this file\n     will not be distributed either.  (You must add \u2018EXTRA_DIST = input\u2019\n     to your \u2018Makefile.am\u2019 if \u2018input\u2019 is a source file.)\n\n     Similarly\n\n          file=output\n          file2=out:in\n          ...\n          AC_CONFIG_FILES([$file:input],, [file=$file])\n          AC_CONFIG_FILES([$file2],, [file2=$file2])\n\n     will only cause \u2018input\u2019 to be distributed.  No file will be cleaned\n     automatically (add \u2018DISTCLEANFILES = output out\u2019 yourself), and no\n     rebuild rule will be output.\n\n     Obviously \u2018automake\u2019 cannot guess what value \u2018$file\u2019 is going to\n     hold later when \u2018configure\u2019 is run, and it cannot use the shell\n     variable \u2018$file\u2019 in a \u2018Makefile\u2019.  However, if you make reference\n     to \u2018$file\u2019 as \u2018${file}\u2019 (i.e., in a way that is compatible with\n     \u2018make\u2019\u2019s syntax) and furthermore use \u2018AC_SUBST\u2019 to ensure that\n     \u2018${file}\u2019 is meaningful in a \u2018Makefile\u2019, then \u2018automake\u2019 will be\n     able to use \u2018${file}\u2019 to generate all of these rules.  For\n     instance, here is how the Automake package itself generates\n     versioned scripts for its test suite:\n\n          AC_SUBST([APIVERSION], ...)\n          ...\n          AC_CONFIG_FILES(\n            [tests/aclocal-${APIVERSION}:tests/aclocal.in],\n            [chmod +x tests/aclocal-${APIVERSION}],\n            [APIVERSION=$APIVERSION])\n          AC_CONFIG_FILES(\n            [tests/automake-${APIVERSION}:tests/automake.in],\n            [chmod +x tests/automake-${APIVERSION}])\n\n     Here cleaning, distributing, and rebuilding are done automatically,\n     because \u2018${APIVERSION}\u2019 is known at \u2018make\u2019-time.\n\n     Note that you should not use shell variables to declare \u2018Makefile\u2019\n     files for which \u2018automake\u2019 must create \u2018Makefile.in\u2019.  Even\n     \u2018AC_SUBST\u2019 does not help here, because \u2018automake\u2019 needs to know the\n     file name when it runs in order to check whether \u2018Makefile.am\u2019\n     exists.  (In the very hairy case that your setup requires such use\n     of variables, you will have to tell Automake which \u2018Makefile.in\u2019s\n     to generate on the command-line.)\n\n     It is possible to let \u2018automake\u2019 emit conditional rules for\n     \u2018AC_CONFIG_FILES\u2019 with the help of \u2018AM_COND_IF\u2019 (*note Optional::).\n\n     To summarize:\n        \u2022 Use literals for \u2018Makefile\u2019s, and for other files whenever\n          possible.\n        \u2022 Use \u2018$file\u2019 (or \u2018${file}\u2019 without \u2018AC_SUBST([file])\u2019) for\n          files that \u2018automake\u2019 should ignore.\n        \u2022 Use \u2018${file}\u2019 and \u2018AC_SUBST([file])\u2019 for files that \u2018automake\u2019\n          should not ignore.\n",
