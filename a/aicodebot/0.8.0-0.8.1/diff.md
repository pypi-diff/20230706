-We've planned to build out multiple different interfaces for interacting with AICodeBot. To start, it's a [command-line tool](https://pypi.org/project/aicodebot/) that you can use to generate commit messages, debug code, and review code. In the future, we plan to integrate it with GitHub Actions, Slack, and other tools to make it even more useful.

 `aicodebot` is a tool for developers, not a replacement for them. It's not going to replace your job, but it will make your job easier and more fun. It's not going to take over the world, but it will help us build a better one. See the *Alignment* section below for more.
 
-It's also not a "build a site for me in 5 minutes" tool that takes a well constructed prompt and builds a scaffold for you. There are [other tools](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer) for that, Instead, AICodeBot is built to work with existing code bases and help you improve them at the git-commit level. It's designed to multiply the effectiveness of capable engineers.

 ## Current features - how you can use it today
 
-### AI Sidekick
+### AI Sidekick ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
 
  `aicodebot sidekick` Your AI-powered coding assistant. It's designed to help you with your coding tasks by providing context-aware suggestions and solutions. Think ChatGPT with the ability to read local files for context.
 
  ```bash
  aicodebot sidekick file1.py file2.py
  ```
 
 In this example, the sidekick will read in the contents of file1.py and file2.py and use them to provide context-aware answers. For example:
 
 * How can I make this code better?
 * Tell me how to add a new feature to this code.
-* Fix an issue that I'm having when... (describe the issue)
+* Fix an issue that I'm having... (paste the error, stack trace, etc.)
 * Write unit tests for the xyz function.
 
-Please note that this feature is still in its experimental stage. While it can already provide valuable assistance, it's not perfect and we're continuously working on improving it.
+Pro-tip: add your README.md to the list of files to get context-aware answers.
+
+This feature is in it's early phases right now, but it's already useful. We'll be adding support for tools that the sidekick can use, including GitHub integration, ingeseting repo specific domain knowledge, writing local files, and more.

 ### Open AI key setup
 
 The first time you run it, you'll be prompted to enter your OpenAI API Key, which is required, as we use OpenAI's large language models for the AI. You can get one for free by visiting your [API key settings page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys").
 
 #### Which Language Model? GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4
 
 When using AICodeBot, you have the option to use either GPT-3.5 or GPT-4. While GPT-4 can often provide more accurate and detailed responses, GPT-3.5 is faster and might be sufficient for simpler tasks. We highly recommend GPT-4.
 
 Not all OpenAI accounts have GPT-4 API access enabled. By default, AICodeBot will use GPT-4 if your OpenAI account supports it, we will check the first time you run it. Tip: If your OpenAI API does not support GPT-4, you can ask to be added to the waitlist [here](https://openai.com/waitlist/gpt-4-api)
 
 Note: We'll be adding more options for AI models in the future, including those that can be run locally, such as [GPT4all](https://gpt4all.io/) and HuggingFace's [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/).

With capabilities to perform code reviews, manage dependencies, and even suggest improvements, think of it as your AI version of a pair programmer - a team member that accelerates the pace of development and helps you write better code.
+AICodeBot is a coding assistant designed to make your coding life easier. Think of it as your AI version of a pair programmer. Perform code reviews, create helpful commit messages, debug problems, and help you think through building new features. A team member that accelerates the pace of development and helps you write better code.
 
-We've planned to build out multiple different interfaces for interacting with AICodeBot. To start, it's a [command-line tool](https://pypi.org/project/aicodebot/) that you can use to generate commit messages, debug code, and review code. In the future, we plan to integrate it with GitHub Actions, Slack, and other tools to make it even more useful.

+### What it's NOT
 
 `aicodebot` is a tool for developers, not a replacement for them. It's not going to replace your job, but it will make your job easier and more fun. It's not going to take over the world, but it will help us build a better one. See the *Alignment* section below for more.
 
-It's also not a "build a site for me in 5 minutes" tool that takes a well constructed prompt and builds a scaffold for you. There are [other tools](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer) for that, Instead, AICodeBot is built to work with existing code bases and help you improve them at the git-commit level. It's designed to multiply the effectiveness of capable engineers.

 ## Current features - how you can use it today
 
-### AI Sidekick
+### AI Sidekick ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
 
  `aicodebot sidekick` Your AI-powered coding assistant. It's designed to help you with your coding tasks by providing context-aware suggestions and solutions. Think ChatGPT with the ability to read local files for context.
 
  ```bash
  aicodebot sidekick file1.py file2.py
  ```
 
 In this example, the sidekick will read in the contents of file1.py and file2.py and use them to provide context-aware answers. For example:
 
 * How can I make this code better?
 * Tell me how to add a new feature to this code.
-* Fix an issue that I'm having when... (describe the issue)
+* Fix an issue that I'm having... (paste the error, stack trace, etc.)
 * Write unit tests for the xyz function.
 
-Please note that this feature is still in its experimental stage. While it can already provide valuable assistance, it's not perfect and we're continuously working on improving it.
+Pro-tip: add your README.md to the list of files to get context-aware answers.
+
+This feature is in it's early phases right now, but it's already useful. We'll be adding support for tools that the sidekick can use, including GitHub integration, ingeseting repo specific domain knowledge, writing local files, and more.

 ### Open AI key setup
 
 The first time you run it, you'll be prompted to enter your OpenAI API Key, which is required, as we use OpenAI's large language models for the AI. You can get one for free by visiting your [API key settings page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys").
 
 #### Which Language Model? GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4
 
 When using AICodeBot, you have the option to use either GPT-3.5 or GPT-4. While GPT-4 can often provide more accurate and detailed responses, GPT-3.5 is faster and might be sufficient for simpler tasks. We highly recommend GPT-4.
 
 Not all OpenAI accounts have GPT-4 API access enabled. By default, AICodeBot will use GPT-4 if your OpenAI account supports it, we will check the first time you run it. Tip: If your OpenAI API does not support GPT-4, you can ask to be added to the waitlist [here](https://openai.com/waitlist/gpt-4-api)
 
 Note: We'll be adding more options for AI models in the future, including those that can be run locally, such as [GPT4all](https://gpt4all.io/) and HuggingFace's [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/).

 `aicodebot` is a tool for developers, not a replacement for them. It's not going to replace your job, but it will make your job easier and more fun. It's not going to take over the world, but it will help us build a better one. See the *Alignment* section below for more.
 
-It's also not a "build a site for me in 5 minutes" tool that takes a well constructed prompt and builds a scaffold for you. There are [other tools](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer) for that, Instead, AICodeBot is built to work with existing code bases and help you improve them at the git-commit level. It's designed to multiply the effectiveness of capable engineers.

 ## Current features - how you can use it today
 
-### AI Sidekick
+### AI Sidekick ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
 
  `aicodebot sidekick` Your AI-powered coding assistant. It's designed to help you with your coding tasks by providing context-aware suggestions and solutions. Think ChatGPT with the ability to read local files for context.
 
  ```bash
  aicodebot sidekick file1.py file2.py
  ```
 
 In this example, the sidekick will read in the contents of file1.py and file2.py and use them to provide context-aware answers. For example:
 
 * How can I make this code better?
 * Tell me how to add a new feature to this code.
-* Fix an issue that I'm having when... (describe the issue)
+* Fix an issue that I'm having... (paste the error, stack trace, etc.)
 * Write unit tests for the xyz function.
 
-Please note that this feature is still in its experimental stage. While it can already provide valuable assistance, it's not perfect and we're continuously working on improving it.
+Pro-tip: add your README.md to the list of files to get context-aware answers.
+
+This feature is in it's early phases right now, but it's already useful. We'll be adding support for tools that the sidekick can use, including GitHub integration, ingeseting repo specific domain knowledge, writing local files, and more.

 ### Open AI key setup
 
 The first time you run it, you'll be prompted to enter your OpenAI API Key, which is required, as we use OpenAI's large language models for the AI. You can get one for free by visiting your [API key settings page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys").
 
 #### Which Language Model? GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4
 
 When using AICodeBot, you have the option to use either GPT-3.5 or GPT-4. While GPT-4 can often provide more accurate and detailed responses, GPT-3.5 is faster and might be sufficient for simpler tasks. We highly recommend GPT-4.
 
 Not all OpenAI accounts have GPT-4 API access enabled. By default, AICodeBot will use GPT-4 if your OpenAI account supports it, we will check the first time you run it. Tip: If your OpenAI API does not support GPT-4, you can ask to be added to the waitlist [here](https://openai.com/waitlist/gpt-4-api)
 
 Note: We'll be adding more options for AI models in the future, including those that can be run locally, such as [GPT4all](https://gpt4all.io/) and HuggingFace's [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/).
